## Introduction
Welcome to me doing what everyone seems to be pretty sure in "not doing!" trying every Framework! üåê In this repository, I'm exploring a new web development framework every week. The goal is to understand basic concepts, highlight differences, and note my learning journey. ü§ì

###  Template Note for each framework 
#### Week [X]: [Framework Name]
#### Project Overview
Brief description of the project I built using the Framework during that week.

#### Key Concepts Explored
- **Concept 1:** Description of the concepts.
- **Concept 2:** Description of the concepts.
- **Concept 3:** Description of the concepts.

#### Lessons Learned

- Any notable features or aspects that stood out in Framework.

#### Next Steps
- Specific features or concepts I would like to explore in more detail in the future.
- Resources or documentation that I found particularly helpful.

#### General Reflection
Summarize overarching observations, similarities, and differences between the frameworks I explored so far. Reflect on the overall experience and the impact on the web development perspective I hold based on how I know so little about everything . üòä

#### Conclusion
Closing thoughts on the Framework. Any key takeaways from this experience?

#### Acknowledgments
